* The project is divided into four milestones:

- Milestone 1: The team will figure out a way to process the raw features that produce a set of features that is more manageable and implement
  a simple logistic regression on the processed data.

- Milestone 2: The team will use various classifier families and different parameters to train and test the data. Problems such as imbalance and proper
metrics should also be addressed.

- Milestone 3: The team will choose the best classifier family from Milestone 2 and modify the threshold to get the best result. The choice for the threshold is
based on a specific metric that the team chooses based on comparing with different metrics.

- Milestone 4: The team will find other ways to process the feature, train the model again, and compare it with the first way to
figure out the best model for the dataset.
